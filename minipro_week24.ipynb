    "- time: The time of the observation, and the interval sets to 10s.\n",
    "- bid_weighted_average: The weighted average bid price.  \n",

    "- bid_volumn: The total number of shares that buyers are willing to buy at the corresponding bid price.  \n",
    "- ask_weighted_average: The weighted average ask price.  \n",

    "- bid_ask_ratio: The ratio of bid volume to ask volume.   \n",
    "- Trend: Trend: The direction of the price trend. A value of 1 indicates the price is rising, while a value of 2 indicates the price is falling. A value of 0 indicates the price is stable.   \n",
